### Gify Movie Page:
On Load the page loads (10) giffies based on the movie button selected.
You can select from the preloaded movies, or add your own easily.
 
#### Project Mix up, Adds, Theme

Accept only Movies. Theme is Movies.
Validate with OMDB. Use OMDB to enforce theme on user selection.
Control animations by individual clicks.
Control all animations at once.

###Project Update...

Google was nice enough to remind me that the api keys in this project were exposed.
I put the whole ap up in Heroku, minor changes and now the api keys should be safe there. 
Yikes... :D
